# Store_Statistics
Store Statistics is a program that reads raw data from a text file (11,000+ data entries) and then stores the monthly sales of each product for the year of 2016 for 'ROAD SYSTEMS LTD.' in a database.
The company consists of 15 stores located across Canada and it specializes in selling industrial products. 

The purpose behind this project was to learn about databases, how to deal with large quantities of information, and the manipulation of 2D and 3D arrays. I also learned about frontend frameworks and how to output the data in the most efficient manner possible by using specific formatting techniques.
